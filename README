#README

This is a unnoficial set of vapi files for SDL2, please be wary of using it in stable code.
This edited version is created because there are some issues that need to be ironed out before merging again with the not-so-unofficial repo at https://gitorious.org/sdl-2-0-vala-vapi

If you spot any bug, any missing functionality, or any regression, you can report it here too, but please, also report it in the Gitorious repo.
Thanks


###But wait, where's SDL_Log, ..., etc?

The following will not be implemented:
 - SDL_loadso.h: There's a better implementation of that using gmodule-2.0 (part of GLib framework)
 - SDL_log.h: GLib provides a more powerful log implementation
 - SDL_system.h: Already provided by GLib
 - SDL_platform.h: Not useful on Vala
 - SDL_endian.h: Already provided by GLib
 - SDL_bits.h: Already provided by GLib
 - SDL_stdinc.h: Already provided by GLib
 - SDL_filesystem.h: Already provided by GLib
